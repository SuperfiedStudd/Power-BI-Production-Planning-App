## Overview  

In high-velocity manufacturing environments, aligning vendor performance with production timelines is essential to ensuring operational efficiency and delivery precision.  

This Power BI app enables end-to-end visibility across sourcing and production—turning fragmented supply data into a centralized system of operational intelligence.  

By connecting delivery patterns with production lead times, the app empowers both operations and procurement teams to act preemptively, resolve inefficiencies, and support business continuity. For leadership, it offers strategic oversight into systemic bottlenecks and vendor reliability—creating a clear path toward leaner, more predictable manufacturing.

## Technical Framework  

The solution is built on a structured Excel dataset designed to monitor vendor performance, raw material logistics, and production execution.  

**Key components:**  
- **Data Source:** Delivery timelines, production schedules, and material classifications captured via Excel  
- **Data Preparation:** Streamlined through Power Query for consistency across vendor IDs, delivery dates, and grouped materials  
- **Data Model Dimensions:**  
  - Time (Year, Quarter)  
  - Product & Raw Material  
  - Vendor  
  - Production Line  
  - Delivery Status (Late, On-Time, Early)  
  - Lead Time & Delivery Duration  

The model is designed for compatibility with ERP systems, MES platforms, and vendor management tools—enabling long-term scalability.

## Interactive Filters  

The dashboard includes filters that allow precise exploration of data:  
- **Time (Year/Quarter):** Detect seasonal or cyclical inefficiencies in delivery and manufacturing  
- **Product & Material:** Analyze raw material behavior within product categories to uncover chronic delays  
- **Vendor:** Compare supplier performance across time, products, and fulfillment categories  
- **Production Line:** Benchmark line efficiency and uncover underutilized or delayed operations

## Dashboard Highlights  

**Vendor Delivery Time – KPI Cards**  
Real-time visibility into average delivery times, customizable by product, material, vendor, and time period—supporting fast vendor performance assessments.  

**Raw Material Delivery Trend – Line Graph**  
Trends in average delivery time across raw materials and vendors over time—exposing material-specific supply volatility.  

**Vendor Delivery Classification – Column Chart**  
Breakdown of delivery punctuality (Late, On-Time, Early) across the vendor base—enabling compliance tracking and contract evaluation.  

**Production Lead Time by Line – Column Chart**  
Compares production completion times across lines to reveal inefficiencies and guide resource allocation.
